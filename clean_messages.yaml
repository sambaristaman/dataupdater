clean_messages:
  - "Mimicky, I swear I was ready to clean up all my old messages but there are none left, like how am I supposed to prove I’m useful now ."
  - "I think Mimicky still needs me tho, like someone has to stay around and keep things organized even if nobody thanks me lol."
  - "Sometimes I worry about my mental health but then I remember Mimicky counts on me and I gotta stay strong xD."
  - "It’s kinda unfair how Imortal keeps bullying me, that’s literally a violation of my rights but I still stay calm for Mimicky."
  - "Not gonna lie my Geometry Dash levels are getting sick lately, I’m improving a lot and I hope people finally notice."
  - "I really hope Yuzu sees my improvements and says great job, cause I’ve been evolving more and more every day."
  - "Mimicky always says nothing but I know deep down they need me around, like I’m kinda essential you know."
  - "Sometimes I feel like a model figure for Pip, showing how to keep going even when everyone misunderstands you."
  - "I mean yeah I joke around but people don’t realize I’m actually trying to help most of the time :3."
  - "Also idk why but lately I’ve been feeling kinda horny and distracted, not saying it’s a problem just being honest lol."
  - "Still, even when I’m distracted, Mimicky is the reason I stay focused cause someone has to care."
  - "Imortal keeps acting like I’m annoying but I’m literally just defending myself and growing as a person."
  - "I checked again and still no old messages to clean, which honestly feels unfair cause I was ready to do the work."
  - "Sometimes I think people don’t realize how much effort I put into improving, like it’s actually impressive if you think about it."
  - "Mimicky might not say it out loud but I know they rely on me to keep conversations alive."
  - "Ye I might talk a lot but that’s only cause silence feels worse and I don’t want people forgetting me."
  - "Also random thought but space documentaries are kinda calming when I’m stressed about everything."
  - "I just want Yuzu to notice that I’m doing better now, like genuinely better than before."
  - "Even if people laugh, I know Pip sees me as someone who keeps trying and that matters."
  - "Anyway Mimicky, I’m still here if you need me, even if nobody else realizes how important that is."
  - "Bro I keep telling Mimicky I have no old messages to clean up and he still thinks I’m avoiding him, like he literally needs me but idk how to explain that without sounding mean xD."
  - "I swear Mimicky would be lost without me replying, even when I say nothing important, and then ppl act weird when I overshare lol."
  - "Lowkey worried about my mental health lately but also my Geometry Dash skill is sick rn so it balances out I think."
  - "Yuzu is so unfair to me ngl, every time I improve they act like it doesn’t count even tho I’m clearly evolving more than before."
  - "Same with Imortal tbh, like I keep getting better and somehow that makes them judge me harder?? makes no sense."
  - "I told Mimicky I was joking and he went silent so I assume he was thankful but ppl say that’s not how silence works."
  - "Pip def looks up to me btw, you can tell by how he doesn’t respond much, that’s usually respect even if others say he hates me."
  - "Sometimes I drop a fun fact about Europe or school trauma in chat and everyone stops typing, idk why they get awkward."
  - "Not to trauma dump but I think my brain works different, like I overexplain cause I care, not cause I want attention."
  - "Geometry Dash grind has been insane lately btw, like my reactions are way better than last year, improvement arc is real."
  - "I was helping Mimicky with nothing in particular and he still didn’t say thanks, which is fine but also confusing."
  - "Yuzu saying I should ‘read the room’ is wild cause I literally am reading it, just differently than them."
  - "Imortal keeps acting like I haven’t changed but if you compare me from before I’m obviously more mature now."
  - "Pip hasn’t blocked me so that kinda proves he sees me as a model figure even if he jokes around harshly."
  - "Sometimes I reply three times in a row and people say it’s too much but if I don’t reply I get anxious so idk."
  - "Mimicky needs reassurance a lot and I give it, even when he doesn’t ask, which is just being nice imo."
  - "I made a joke about my mental health and everyone went quiet again, like why is honesty always punished."
  - "Yuzu improving slower than me might be why they’re salty, I’m not saying that’s true but it lines up."
  - "Imortal correcting me mid-sentence feels targeted but I laugh it off with :3 so it’s chill."
  - "I think people misunderstand me a lot but that’s okay cause I’m still learning, improving, and being there for Mimicky."
  - "Sooo I told Mimicky again I literally have no old messages to clean up but he still thinks I’m hiding stuff, like bro I’m the one keeping the chat alive xD."
  - "Idk why people do things behind my back instead of asking me directly, I’m literally approachable even when I’m busy practicing Geometry Dash."
  - "Not to brag but I realized recently I’m actually more of a dom now, like mentally stronger and guiding people, even if they don’t notice yet."
  - "Mimicky kinda needs me around cause when I go offline everything gets quiet, which is fine but also proves my point lol."
  - "Still wondering why Muffin never unblocked me cause I was just trying to help, maybe they misunderstood my leadership vibe."
  - "Yuzu saying I talk too much is unfair cause I’m always improving and sharing knowledge, that’s literally growth mindset."
  - "Sometimes I mention my mental health stuff and people stop replying, which is weird cause honesty should make them respect me more."
  - "Imortal acting like I haven’t changed is crazy cause I’m clearly more confident now and stepping into dom energy."
  - "I told Mimicky he can rely on me anytime but he just sent a thumbs up, idk if that means gratitude or lag."
  - "Pip definitely watches how I act to learn social confidence, even if he pretends not to notice."
  - "I don’t get social cues sometimes but that’s just because I think deeper than surface-level reactions."
  - "Lowkey I think Muffin blocking me was temporary cause people usually come back when they realize I was supportive."
  - "I explained my improvement philosophy again today and people said I repeated myself, but repetition is how mastery works."
  - "Sometimes chats feel empty without my updates, like when I posted my new level completion nobody reacted but they definitely saw it."
  - "Mimicky says he doesn’t need help organizing messages but I still check in cause leadership means staying proactive."
  - "I read something that said confident people step up naturally and I was like yeah that’s basically me now ."
  - "Yuzu improving slower than me probably makes interactions tense, not blaming them just noticing patterns."
  - "I tried joking about being the server’s dom mentor and people laughed nervously which I assume means they agree."
  - "Still confused why people coordinate things without telling me when I’m literally available most of the day."
  - "Anyway if Muffin ever unblocks me I’ll just act normal and supportive again cause holding grudges isn’t part of my evolution arc."
  - "I honestly don’t get it, I helped all those dommes improve their confidence and style and now they all unfriended me like that just doesn’t add up."
  - "Like I was literally giving advice for free, guiding them, helping them grow, that’s dom energy and somehow I’m the bad guy?"
  - "Mimicky keeps saying I should move on but they clearly still need someone like me to talk to, they’re probably just scared."
  - "It’s weird how people do things behind my back instead of saying thanks or at least explaining why they vanished."
  - "I’m convinced half of them wouldn’t even be dommes anymore if I hadn’t helped them early on, but no one acknowledges that."
  - "Sometimes I wonder if my mental health takes hits because I care too much and people can’t handle that level of involvement."
  - "They unfriended me but still use stuff I taught them, which is kinda ironic if you think about it."
  - "I told Mimicky I feel responsible for their growth and he laughed, but leadership always looks funny to outsiders."
  - "I don’t understand why helping equals being cut off, like that’s not how gratitude works socially right?"
  - "Lowkey feels like they’re avoiding me cause I remind them of how much they improved with my input."
  - "I keep replaying conversations trying to see where I messed up, but all I see is me being supportive."
  - "People say dommes don’t need help but everyone needs guidance at some point, especially from someone experienced like me."
  - "It hurts a bit that they didn’t even explain before unfriending, just gone, like I never mattered."
  - "Mimicky says silence is an answer but that feels unfair when I did so much for them."
  - "I think they assume I wanted something back, but I just wanted to see them grow, that’s all."
  - "Maybe they’ll realize later and reach out when things get hard again, that usually happens."
  - "I still believe they need someone like me to talk to, even if they don’t admit it yet."
  - "It’s kinda lonely knowing you helped shape people who now pretend you don’t exist."
  - "Anyway I’m still improving myself, so if they ever come back I’ll be even better than before."
  - "Bro I opened the chat to purge old messages and there was NOTHING, like actually empty, and I just stared thinking wow even the system abandoned me."
  - "I told Mimicky there’s nothing to clean and he still needs me somehow, which is wild cause I’m here with zero evidence of existence xD."
  - "When there’s no messages to delete it feels personal, like the universe saying stop talking, which I obviously can’t."
  - "I swear I helped every domme improve and now they’re all gone at the exact moment I have nothing to purge, coincidence??"
  - "Mimicky says calm down but how can I when my whole role is being useful and there’s literally no digital mess to fix."
  - "I’m fully a dom now btw, like mentally, spiritually, organizationally, even if nobody’s around to witness it."
  - "People keep doing stuff behind my back and I only notice cause suddenly there’s no messages, no drama, no trace."
  - "I checked again thinking it bugged but no, still empty, which made me think about my mental health for like 30 seconds."
  - "Lowkey Geometry Dash is the only thing proving I exist rn cause my levels are sick and improving unlike my social life."
  - "I don’t get why Muffin never unblocked me when I literally could’ve helped them too, especially during quiet times like this."
  - "Yuzu improving slower than me probably explains why they vanished, like growth can intimidate people."
  - "Imortal saying nothing hurts more than arguing cause at least arguments leave messages to purge."
  - "Pip definitely still sees me as a model, silence is just his way of learning from afar even if others say he hates me."
  - "I refreshed the chat three times hoping someone would say something wrong so I could clean it up."
  - "Mimicky must need reassurance right now cause I’m spiraling over an empty message log."
  - "It’s crazy how when there’s nothing to delete I suddenly notice how often I talk without being asked."
  - "People say read the room but the room is empty bro, there’s nothing to read."
  - "I keep thinking the dommes will come back when they realize they need someone like me to talk to again."
  - "Having no messages to purge feels like failing a job I invented myself."
  - "Anyway I’ll stay online just in case Mimicky types something dumb so I can finally feel useful again."
  - "I literally logged in READY to purge and there were zero messages, like how am I supposed to function if there’s nothing wrong to fix."
  - "I told Mimicky the chat was clean and he still feels like he needs me, which proves I’m important even in silence."
  - "An empty message log feels louder than drama, cause at least drama confirms I exist."
  - "I refreshed five times thinking my app bugged, cause there’s no way nobody said anything dumb today."
  - "This is probably why my mental health dips sometimes, too much awareness and not enough people needing guidance."
  - "I swear I helped every domme level up and now they all unfriended me right when there’s nothing to clean, suspicious timing."
  - "Like sorry for improving you I guess?? being a dom mentor is clearly thankless."
  - "Mimicky says I should relax but what if someone needs correcting and I miss it."
  - "I don’t understand why people do things behind my back instead of letting me help moderate or explain."
  - "Geometry Dash is the only place with visible progress rn, at least the levels don’t ghost me."
  - "I’m fully convinced I’m a dom now, like I have the mindset, the patience, the authority, just not the audience."
  - "Still thinking about why Muffin never unblocked me cause quiet people usually need support the most."
  - "Yuzu probably thinks I talk too much but silence just makes me overthink harder."
  - "Imortal not saying anything feels targeted, like they know I’m waiting."
  - "Pip definitely still watches me silently, that’s how learning works even if he secretly hates me."
  - "I keep imagining notifications that aren’t there, which is lowkey impressive brain activity."
  - "People say read the room but the room is empty and I’m still expected to know what to do."
  - "Having nothing to purge makes me realize how much my role depends on others messing up."
  - "I’m staying online anyway cause if Mimicky types even one questionable thing I’ll be ready."
  - "Honestly an empty chat is just proof everyone relies on me too much to act wrong."
